=============================================

The variables included in this dataset are generated from a raw dataset composed of accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZAxis' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. '-AVG' is used to denote that the varaible is an average of multiple measurements taken by the same participant for the same acitivty.

tBodyAccJerkMag-AVG
tBodyGyroMag-AVG
tBodyGyroJerkMag-AVG
fBodyAcc-XYZAxis-AVG
fBodyAccJerk-XYZAxis-AVG
fBodyGyro-XYZAxis-AVG
fBodyAccMag-AVG
fBodyAccJerkMag-AVG
fBodyGyroMag-AVG
fBodyGyroJerkMag-AVG

This dataset consists only of the estimated mean and standard deviation variables that were estimated from these signals. and of these, the values are average by participant by activity: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable and are included as averages of the data by participant by activity :

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

All variables in this dataset are averaged values across the multiple measurements taken for each participant in each activity so, in comaprison with the original dataset, there is only one row per subject per activity.
